Static site generators like Jekyll are amazing for producing fast, content-based sites, but what if more functionality is needed? Thatâ€™s where these third party tools come into play.

##### Comment System: [Disqus](https://disqus.com/)

Disqus is a great and easy way to add comments to a blog with sizable traffic. 

#####  Gallery/Lightbox Scripts: [Photoswipe](http://photoswipe.com/) and [Lity](http://sorgalla.com/lity/)

It's fairly common to want to include a gallery or lightbox on a website and content management sites can be especially annoying to use with images. Photoswipe and Lity are awesome and lightweight scripts to integrate in a static site. 

##### Calendar: [Tockify](https://tockify.com/)

Tockify is an interesting option for embedding a calendar if more functionality is needed over Google Calendar.

##### Forms: [Formspree](https://formspree.io/) or [Formbucket](https://www.formbucket.com/)

For integrating the standard form, Formspree is simple and free. Formbucket is a more advanced option if needed.

##### Ecommerce: [SnipCart](https://snipcart.com/)

I have not used this yet, but it looks interesting. If I ever needed ecommerce features without the bloat of a platform, I'd give this a shot.

##### CMS for Developers: [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/), [Siteleaf](https://www.siteleaf.com/), [Statamic](https://statamic.com)

These are my go-tos over WordPress. Please, anything but WordPress.
