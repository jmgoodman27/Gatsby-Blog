title: "Why I Rebuilt my Blog with Gatsby"
---
This past weekend, I decided to rebuild my Jekyll blog with Gatsby. So what was the point of this?

First off, if you don't know what Gatsby is, it's a static site generator built for the JavaScript ecosystem and has quickly become one of the most popular static site generators available equipped with React, Webpack, GraphQL, and more ready to go.

Jekyll is a static site generator (built with Ruby) that I've been using that for years. Jekyll was great since it was simple to use, however, setting up build tools around it was a pain. In the past, I used Gulp to handle some tasks, and eventually configured something with Webpack that quickly fell apart. 

I wanted something JavaScript friendly that would allow me to use my favorite JS libraries, and Gatsby was the perfect fit. There's a great community around it already with thorough documentation, making it simple to get something up and running without spending hours on a webpack config. I can add my favorite libraries for any new features, and take advantage of everything React has to offer. Plus, I'm always looking for excuses to practice coding with React.

Part of this initiative as well is to explore concepts like CSS-in-JS as part of my seemingly lifelong quest to put together the best CSS methodology. I think I'm making progress with that as well with a combination of TailwindCSS and Emotion (a CSS-in-JS library). More on that later.

The learning curve for Gatsby isn't that big as well, because it's really just React you're working with. Gatsby just provides tools to make working with React easier. The best part about this stack is that it's not very complicated if you're just building a simple blog site. That's why Gatsby seems to be the most beginner friendly way to dive into the world of React. Rebuilding simple sites is a great way to provide context to these tools and progressively level up JavaScript skills.

So why did I rebuild this blog with Gatsby? To play with the latest JavaScript technology of course!
