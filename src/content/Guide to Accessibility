Semantic HTML

Using semantic HTML elements has ARIA already built in. By using tags like header, main, article, section, aside, and footer, screen readers already know the flow of content.  

Let's look at an example blog post:



Here is boilerplate for a semantic HTML page within the <body> tag:
<body>
    <header>
        Repeatable content like navigation bars
    </header>
    <main>
        Unique page content 
        <article>
            Content that makes sense independent of other content on page
            Examples include blog posts, products, and news articles
            <aside>
                Information that is tangentially related to the article
            </aside>
        </article>
    </main>



Header tag: 
Main tag: The main tag should contain only unique page content.
